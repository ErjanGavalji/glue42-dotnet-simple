## Setup
1) Create a wpf solution with two projects. Those represent a simple instrument list (like a client portfolio) application with a simple company details management application.
2) Clicking upon an instrument in the first application invokes the display of company information in the second one.

## Troubleshooting
- Make sure you have enabled the [Nuget Package restore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-restore-troubleshooting) option if you get errors like `The type of namespace DOT/ServiceContractAttribute/ServiceContract could not be found`.
